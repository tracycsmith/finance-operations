# Investment Strategy

## Guiding Principles

- Liquidity first, growth second
- Aggressive investing only when cash flow is protected
- Minimize decision points

## Retirement Strategy

### Roth IRA
- Annual contribution: $8,000
- Timing:
  - Transfer from CMA on January 1
  - Invest on first market day (typically January 2)
- Asset:
  - 100% VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF)
- Philosophy:
  - Aggressive, long-horizon, tax-free growth
  - Set-and-forget, no rebalancing unless strategy changes

### 401k
- Front-loaded annually
- Strategy:
  - Max HSA contribution first
  - Then up to 90% of paycheck to 401k until maxed (typically through mid-April)
- Requires annual review and rebalance to align with overall strategy

### HSA
- Fully funded early in the year
- Treated as long-term investment vehicle when possible

---

## Cash Management Account (CMA)

### Purpose
- Central liquidity hub
- Replaces traditional checking + savings split
- Prevents forced selling of investments

### Target Balance
- ~$30,000
- Represents ~6 months of obligations:
  - Living expenses
  - Rent
  - Utilities
  - Food
  - Ongoing family support

### Rules
- CMA may fluctuate freely **above** the target
- Do not invest funds that would be needed within 6 months
- Monthly review:
  - Any balance above target is eligible for investment

### Investing Excess Cash
- Frequency: Monthly
- Rule:
  - Invest only the amount exceeding the CMA target
- Destination to be decided (likely taxable VTI or conservative allocation)

---

## Family Support (Dad)
- Approximate monthly support: $1,200
- Lifetime mental cap: ~$33,000 (subject to reassessment)
- Strategy:
  - Fund monthly support just-in-time
  - Do not freeze full amount in low-yield account
  - Track total support vs cap

---

## Philosophy Summary

- Liquidity
- Predictability
- Long-term compounding
- Minimal cognitive overhead
