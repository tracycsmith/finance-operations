# 2025-12-23: HSA Custodian Decision Context

## Purpose

This document captures the context, constraints, and reasoning around a potential
future move of the HSA away from Betterment to Optum self-directed investments.

No action is being taken at this time.

This exists to prevent re-analysis and decision churn later.

---

## Current State

- Betterment Checking: EXITING (tracked elsewhere)
- Betterment Cash Reserve: EXITING (tracked elsewhere)
- Betterment HSA: **REMAINS ACTIVE**
  - Investments only
  - No cash movement planned

Betterment will remain in use **only** as an HSA custodian once the cash exit is complete.

---

## Problem Being Considered (Deferred)

Whether to:
- Keep Betterment as an HSA-only platform (automated, low-touch), **or**
- Fully remove Betterment by moving the HSA to Optum self-directed investments

This decision is intentionally deferred until after all cash operations are complete.

---

## Key Tradeoff Identified

The decision is not about returns.

It is about:

- **Fewer external institutions**
  vs
- **Recurring attention / self-management burden**

A winning solution must:
- Reduce long-term cognitive load
- Avoid systems that demand recurring attention without urgency
- Be intentionally boring and inert once set

---

## Decision Status

- ❌ No HSA transfer during Betterment cash exit
- ✅ Revisit only after:
  - Checking and Cash Reserve are closed
  - Fidelity setup is stable
  - Rent payments are flowing correctly

Any future decision must lock into a **single, low-maintenance approach**.

---

## Guiding Principles

- Prefer fewer institutions only if the replacement system is inert
- Eliminate “helpful” automation that still requires trust monitoring
- Choose simplicity over optimization
- Never stack major financial changes simultaneously

---

## Status

- HSA decision: **PARKED**
- Urgency: **NONE**
- Next review window: Post–Betterment exit, no sooner than 1–2 weeks
