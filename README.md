# FinOps

This repository documents my personal and business financial operating system.

Purpose:
- Single source of truth for financial strategy, structure, and decisions
- Versioned, auditable, and time-aware (GitHub-native)
- Easy to hand to a CFP, executor, or trusted party if needed

This repo favors **clarity, intent, and durability** over tooling cleverness.

High-level structure:
- /Personal — personal finance, investing, liquidity, obligations
- /Refineo — Refineo Studios financials
- /LWD — Leading While Distracted financials
